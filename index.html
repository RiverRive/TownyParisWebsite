              <b>Towny Paris</b> is a Minecraft community that plays on multiplayer towny servers to hopefully one day achieve something more than just a unique Minecraft experience. 
              Make sure you read the <a href="rules.html">rules</a>. Once you have read and understood the town rules, it's time to begin your journey! 
              Here, we have provided guides and information on several features we have to offer. Feel free to browse around and discover something new!
            </p>
            <p>
              Current Minecraft servers we play on:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <!-- <img src="thecavernbanner.jpg" alt="TheCavern">
                <p>Server IP: mc.thecavern.net | Website: <a  href="https://thecavern.net/index.php?route=/">https://thecavern.net/index.php?route=/</a></p> -->
                <p>We are not currently playing on any server yet!</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Paris has many things to offer in-game! We hope to provide farms, animals/grinders, PVP arenas, class wonders, and free plots with zero taxes. 
              Additionally, we provide an official town discord and a <a href="townmap.html">town map</a>. 
              If you ever need help or have any questions about the town, feel free to join our discord:

            <p>
              Paris also includes a department system that allows town members to do many unique things for the town. 
              Each department gives you access to a variety of roles and ranks. 
              Join the building department and complete, splendid world wonders! 
              Or maybe the resource department fits you better? 
              Collect resources at your leisure for town projects! 
              After all, we are all here to have fun and enjoy the community.
