            <h2>Town Rules</h2>
            <p>
                Paris, the city of light and love, welcomes you! Join us in our adventure in recreating Paris and its wonders. 
                We are a goal-orientated Minecraft community with hopes of one day becoming a beacon of success on a server. 
                With your help, we can achieve many things. 
                Whatever contributions you make to the town, from building your humble home to joining the staff, we value absolutely anything, every little bit counts! 
                We're all in this together. Our main goal for the server is to grow a developed and close community that can win towny!

                The following text is the list of rules you must follow at all times. 
                Failure to follow these rules will result in a friendly warning. 
                Unless the rules were severely broken, then you may lose all ties with the Paris community. Town mayors reserve the right to change the rules. 
                Any changes to the rules will be on the Paris Towny discord.
            </p>

                <li>You are not allowed to build or destroy on top of town borders unless you are a department member. If you can not find a plot or need help in general, please contact the mayor or any well known online town member for assistance. If no one is online, one way of doing this is by using /mail send (player name) (message).</li>
                <li>If you own a small plot (1 chunk), you must follow these building rules:
                    <ul style="text-align: left;">
                        <li>The height limit is 15 blocks above the ground.</li>
                        <li>You can not build on top of the grass border, but you can have overhangs more than 3 blocks above the ground.</li>
                        <li>You can not build on top of the roads, not even overhangs.</li>
                        <li>You can build a basement to bedrock within your town chunk. </li>
                        <li>No active beacons are allowed on your plot when you are offline. To elaborate, you can use the beacon block as decoration. Also, you are only allowed to use active beacons when you are online.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>If you own a large plot (2 by 2 chunks), you must follow these building rules:

                        <li>You are expected to build something festive and splendid, it does not have to be a mansion.</li>
                        <li>The height limit is 30-45 blocks above the ground.</li>
                        <li>Large plots are earned through dedication to the town.</li>
                        <li>No active beacons are allowed on your plot when offline.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>If you plan on leaving the town do the following:
                    <ul style="text-align: left;">
                        <li>Remove all your chests</li>
                        <li>Remove all your furnaces</li>
                        <li>Remove any locked containers you /locked</li>
                        <li>Chests, furnaces, doors, and trapdoors could all be automatically locked when you place them.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>  
            <ul style="text-align: left;">
