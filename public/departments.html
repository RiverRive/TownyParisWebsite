                    <p>Departments do many unique things that help the town in their unique ways. 
                        Joining a department is completely voluntary! Members need to understand that there are no bosses, deadlines, or requirements. 
                        Instead, you would work at your own pace and style! 
                        Also, you will be given special powers to carry out your objectives, so you will still need to be somewhat responsible. 
                        But other than that, you are the boss of yourself!
                    </p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Here are brief descriptions of each department:</p>
                    <ul style="text-align: left;">
                        <li><a href="#recruitment"><b style="color: rgb(39, 158, 39);">Recruitment</b></a> - These people invite and help new residents join the town. This includes touring newcomers and selling out plots to them, as well as helping them with rules and commands.</li><br>
                        <li><a href="#maintenance"><b style="color: rgb(71, 164, 196);">Maintenance</b></a> - These people do random check ups on roads and plots. They clear plots that are unfinished and inactive, and fix roads that might have been griefed. One of the easier tasks, but also one of the most important!</li><br>
                        <li><a href="#building"><b style="color: rgb(146, 38, 196);">Building</b></a> - These people build absolutely anything, from simple roads to elaborate wonders. Resources and schematic files would be provided.</li><br>
                        <li><a href="#resources"><b style="color: rgb(243, 29, 214);">Resources</b></a> - Huge support for builders and map artists. As you might have guessed, these people mine for resources needed by the town.</li><br>
                        <li><a href="#commerce"><b style="color: rgb(184, 176, 72);">Commerce</b></a> - These people maintain shops or create new ones. Shop maintenance includes making sure you have a high personal balance and making sure the shops are full or empty depending on the circumstance.</li><br>
                        <li><a href="#mapart"><b style="color: rgb(245, 142, 47);">Map Art</b></a> - Map artists do horizontal pixel art, which are then mapped to produce beautiful paintings. A really nifty program that converts any image to minecraft map art would be provided.</li><br>
                        <!-- <li><a href="#terraforming"><b style="color: rgb(236, 65, 65);">Terraforming</b></a> - These people create land on massive scales.

                        <h3>Pro tips</h3>
                            <p>
                                Players will ask to join a town every once in a while, so you can invite them right away if you would like.<br>
                            </p>
                            <img src="departmentPics/recruitmentpic.jpg" alt="recruitmentpic">
                            <p>
                                Offering a tour of the town before inviting them or sending indirect invitations using dms is a great idea going about inviting new residents and is highly encouraged! This method is very effective in filtering new residents who are better off and who will stay longer in the town community.<br>
                                If someone you are talking to is undecided whether they should join the town or not, it’s up to you to convince them to join! The more experience you have the better the chance you’ll win them over, so experiment!<br>
                                Eventually, if you seek to invite new residents a lot, you will realise that there are new players on the server that do not talk at all in chat and who in fact would like to join a town. If you are able to find these players (ie. using tab), then private message them, who knows they might be willing to join the town!<br>
                            </p>

                        <h3>Extra info</h3>
                            <p>
                                Members of this department could earn extra ingame money from mayors for inviting new residents to the town.<br>
                                Being part of this department is both rewarding and challenging. Many players will appreciate your invites and others will reject them. Being tilt-proof is the best weapon for this department.<br>
                                If you need help or have any questions about the department please ask other members in the department first before asking help from mayors.<br>
                                When new members join this department it is highly recommended for senior members of the department to coach them.<br>

                                It will be very common to find pampered roads, it will be up to you to fix them. Additionally, removed leaves on plot corners are ok and do not need to be replaced.<br>

                                When trying to remove locked chests on evicted plots, try to catch the owner of these locked chests online to make them physically remove the chests themselves by private messaging them. If they are not a resident of Paris, you will definitely need to know how to set a town plot type to embassy and then back to plot type regular. Otherwise, if there is no way to contact the owner of the chests, proceed with plot eviction and leave the locked chests on the plot for mayors/server staff to remove eventually. Mayors should be making weekly plot inspections for removing protections. Unless members of this department can…

                                    Hello, I am the <em><b>mayor/helper</b></em> of Paris. In our town rules we say that residents who own town plots can get evicted if (1) their house is not well done (ex. box house, unfinished house) AND (2) they have been inactive for 7+ days in a row. Recently, we cleared <em><b>X#</b></em> resident plots that had these criteria. However we cannot clear everything on these plots because they have locked containers and doors which are owned by the evicted member. Is there a way to remove them? Thank you.<br>
                                    Plots with protections:<br>
                                    (e.g)(-573, 265)<br>
                                    (e.g)(-572, 263)<br>
                                    (e.g)(-572, 260)<br>

                                It is highly recommended for members of this department to discuss together the removal of a borderline/subpar house. If you have doubts about a house, ask others for their opinions, but please don’t be too picky!<br>

                                If blueprints/schematics files are not provided in a project overview, then you may improvise builds. Additionally, all the schematics/builds we send out are authentically made by Zeus and Hades!<br>

                                Paris Shops will be located south of town spawn, inside the Grand Palais. With the addition of town farms and the map art market.<br>
                                Resources from the resource department may only be used for building shops. You are not allowed to use resources from the resource department to sell items as a means of personal profit.<br>
                                We plan to build a prosperous server macro shop which can provide many materials for the public. Eventually, as ambition as it may sound, our goal is to reach a point where the shop is non profit.<br>
                                We also plan to build a server micro shop for individuals who wish to own a small part of a large set of small shops.<br>

                                As mayor, I never got the chance to make a shop, therefore, I do not have any tips on how to make a successful shop. I will be very lenient towards this department hoping to be very flexible with department decisions. However, we still have specific goals to achieve.<br>
                                It will be up to the department to find the best prices for objects to be sold and bought.<br>

                                All map art builds will be built outside of Paris in a separate town far from the main one.<br>
                                Any map arts that want to be built (public or private) will need to get a light inspection from town mayors to check for sanity which includes but not limited to inappropriate propaganda, violence, and resources used.<br>
                                The map art department will be split into 2 separate sectors. The first being the Public Sector, and the second being the Private Sector.<br>
                                Here is how it’s going to work:
                                <ol style="list-style-type: circle;"><b>Public Sector</b>
                                    <li>Map arts are requested and built depending on majority rule and/or mayors.<br></li>
                                    <li>When building public map art the use of the resource dept is highly encouraged.<br></li>
                                    <li>Anyone who helps build public map arts will be given credit for building the map art. <br></li>
                                    <li>Whoever proposed a public map art will NOT be credited for having proposed the map art. We encourage those who want to be credited for their proposal to build map art in the Private Sector.<br></li>
                                    <li>Public map art will be sold under the name of the town. This means that whoever sells the public map art <b>must</b> deposit the profits into the town bank. <br></li>
                                    <li>The public sector can help against conflicting individuals who all want to do the same private map art.<br></li>
                                    <li>If you are a member who does not have any ideas for map arts and just wants to help, this sector is for you.<br></li>
                                    <li>The public sector will be limited to <b>2</b> map arts built at once.<br></li>
                                </ol>
                                <ol style="list-style-type: circle;"><b>Private Sector</b>
                                    <li>Map arts are requested and built by individuals. This means that to proceed in building a private map art, <b>ONE</b> player has to be signed onto the map art.<br></li>
                                    <li>When building private map art the use of the resource department is highly <b>dis</b>couraged. Obviously there are some exceptions to this, please talk to town mayors for approval before using the resource department. Otherwise if you are not allowed, please collect the resource you need on your own.<br></li>
                                    <li>Outside town members are allowed to help build, however their credit will completely depend on the owner of the map art.<br></li>
                                    <li>Whoever proposed a private map art must claim their map art privately with town mayors. If you seek public opinion on whether or not you should build your private map art, mayors are not responsible for stolen map art ideas.<br></li>
                                    <li>Private map art will be sold under the name of who ever owns the map art. This means that whoever sells the private map art <b>must</b> give the profits to the owner of the map art. <br></li>
                                    <li>Private co-ops are not restricted, however <b>ONE</b> player must claim the map art. This is to avoid any conflicting issues which includes single player chestshops and unbalanced workloads. If multiple players seek private ownership of one map art, the public sector can be an easy solution. This is why we encourage map art owners to claim map arts privately with town mayors.<br></li>
                                    <li>Private map art owners can only work on <b>ONE</b> map art at time, you are not allowed to claim more than one map art at once.<br></li>
                                </ol>
                                All original map arts could be stored in the louvre and copies will be sold at the Paris shop (public and private).<br>
                                If something does not look right in the town report it to mayors/assistants.<br>

                                Our most highly recommended program to use includes: <a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/azdin2/minecraft-map-art-helper/blob/master/minecraft-map-art-helper.htm">Map Art Program</a><br>
                                The directions you need are written on the website, but always remember to select “Craig’s formula” and make sure the image you select in 128x128 pixels. This is a very user friendly program.<br>
                                Try not to build overly detailed map-arts, important features may become unrecognizable!<br>
                                <b>Maps can be locked when using a glass pane in a cartography table. This creates a new Map containing the same data and locks it. All copies of this new map are also locked. A locked map never changes, even when the depicted terrain changes.</b><br>

                                You are allowed to use resources from the resource department for terraforming purposes only. Additionally, the resources you gain from terraforming could also be donated to the resource department.<br>
                                Mainland Paris will be settled on an ocean so that terraforming can be done fast. Terraforming on an ocean will comprise of lava pouring onto the surface of water.<br>
                                If something does not look right in the town report it to mayors/assistants<br>

                                Terraforming on land masses will be the most self explanatory (ex. destroy mountains and/or flatten terrain). However because Paris is settled on an ocean, mountains are irrelevant and the water is already a flat surface we can take advantage of!<br>
                                Most of Paris terraforming will require only lava buckets, and basic calculations.<br>
                                Here is how it's done:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Outline the region you want to terraform using the f3 + g Minecraft feature to help outline the chunks necessary to terraform. <br></li>
                                    <li>Pour lava onto water in an efficient manner. <br></li>
                                    <li>Fill in the missed wholes. Done!<br></li>
                                </ol>
                                Step 1 (ex. 3x2 chunks)<br>
